# BDFextractor
A command-line tool to extract HR information from BDF/EDF files

# Disclaimer

This software is an **extremely simplified** command-line version of [EDFbrowser](http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/). EDFbrowser is a free, opensource, multiplatform, universal viewer and toolbox intended for, but not limited to, timeseries storage files like EEG, EMG, ECG, BioImpedance, etc. 

BDFextractor was developed out of the need to bulk extract HR information from BDF files available in the [MAHNOB-HCI](http://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/) database. Users are advised to refer to EDFbrowser for a complete solution regarding BDF/EDF files.
